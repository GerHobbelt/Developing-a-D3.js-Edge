# Working title: Developing a D3.js Edge

**To Be Done** 

This is the repository containing all sources, data sets and miscelleaneous documentation bits and pieces for the book.

Directory organization should be pretty self-explanatory.



## Note about reshuffling the directory tree

When the structure needs to change, this can be handled very elegantly by git when you make sure to 'git add' the moved directories (files, rather) in the very same commit that marks their old place as 'removed': git will detect the 'move' and any branch/merge activity will go smoothly then.
