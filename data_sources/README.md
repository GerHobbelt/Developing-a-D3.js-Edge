# The Data Sources

Here we collect the data sources used by the book's source code.

There are two reasons to store the data sets here:

- so you may peruse the code locally while being off-line (e.g. when you're on the plane and run a webserver on localhost or use another means to kickstart the 'website' that constitutes the book's examples / applications)

- to provide a reliable snapshot of the data as used by the book's code; you will still have everything necessary for looking at and through the applications even when the original data source has moved or disappeared off the Net.
